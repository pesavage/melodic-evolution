# melodic-evolution
Code and source data for:
Savage, P. E., Passmore, S., Chiba, G., Currie, T. E., Suzuki, H., & Atkinson, Q. D. (2020). Sequence alignment of folk song melodies reveals cross-cultural mechanisms of musical evolution. PsyArXiv Preprint. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/5rj6y

To run the analyses, type:

source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pesavage/melodic-evolution/master/MelodicEvo.R")

in R or R Studio. Several of the sub-scripts are commented out because they have been pre-calculated. In particular, the distance matrices and identification of highly related melodies have been pre-calculated, so you don't need to run the "PID.R" or "Dist.R" subscripts. To recalculate distance matrices and re-identify highly related pairs, uncomment the following lines of code from "MelodicEvo.R" after downloading the full English and Japanese distance matrices from https://osf.io/nhvzw/ (but be aware that this will take up to a month on a standard computer):

source("PID.R")

source("Dist.R")

Because the main MelodicEvoSeq.csv file used in analyses can't preserve the detailed formatting (e.g., bold, italic, etc. for functional positions), a MelodicEvoSeq.xlsx file with formatting for the highly related pairs is also included for convenience.
